				<h2 class="title">Araya's: Best Thai Food in LA</h2>
				<p>You need to go and try this out. You will thank me after you do. It has 4 different locations, 3 of which are in Oregon and one in SoCal. I have been to the small one in Beverly Hills and OH MY GOD. This is the best Thai food I have ever had. It is a small, hole in the wall place (location isn't the best) but the inside is nice and modern. Some people might be turned off by the idea of no meat, but let me tell you, that it does not matter. Even my boyfriend who is a meat lover, is in LOVE with this place. They have such amazing spices and flavor that you won't even notice that there is no meat in the food.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Spaghetti Store: Lugano, Switzerland</h2>
				<p>BEST. PIZZA. EVER. No seriously though. This Napolitan Pizza is served on a "tagliere" (aka cutting board) and offers plenty to eat for 2. This may be in Switzerland, but it definitely could compete to pizzas made in Naples. Another great thing about this place is that you can literally put anything, ANYTHING, you want on it. Extra toppings include any kind of cold cut meats to several different types of cheeses. Wish I could order this instead of Pizza Hut. I have yet to find a good pizza place in LA. 800 degrees is okay but still not on paar with this.</p>

				<h2 class="title">KBBQ and Korean Food: LA</h2>
				<p>Korean food is everywhere in LA, especially in Korea Town. And of course everyone has heard of all you can eat KBBQ! There are a lot of all you can eat KBBQ places around, some are cheaper than others, and some have more options of meat than others. The best one I have had so far with the most number of options is Kogi King. For only $20, they offer the biggest list of different meats as well as side dishes such as rice and soups. There are other KBBQ places, such as Odesan, that also offer traditional Korean dishes that are also very delicious.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Zipfer Bierhaus: Salzburg, Austria</h2>
				<p>When people in the United States think of Austrian/German food, all most people think about is sausage, potatos, and beer. Now, yes they do eat a lot of that but that isn't the only thing! Plus those foods are delicious. However be careful if going to Austria to not call them German, they will get very offended and sternly remind you that they are NOT Germans, they are Austrians. If you found yourself in Mozart's hometown (Salzburg), then you have to stop by Zipfer and have their traditional food. They have everything from cheese filled sausage, to schnitzel. Their selection of beer is also amazing. Their interior decor is definitely older and perhaps a little outdated, but that it what makes it an authentic and amazing Austrian restaurant. Plus it is located right in the center of Salzburg so you cannot miss it.</p>
