					<p>I can't even deal. Jeffree went from having just 3 liquid lipstick shades to having his own MakeUp palette and highlighters! In such a small time that is no easy task for sure. Pricing is not too bad, but of course it is not as cheap as MakeUp Geek. Still fair and you do get a lot of product so. Another great thing about this line is that they have such innovative colors! Jeffree doesn't just create your typical nudes (which he does offer and they are also GORGEOUS). His highlighters are also incredible and are HUGE in size! Jeffree keeps coming out with new shades and products each month it seems and we are definitely not complaining about it! Keep up the good work! It is always nice to see and indie MakeUp brand suceed in the midst of giants like Channel and Giorgio Armani.</p>

					<h2 class="title">MakeUp Geek Cosmetics</h2>
					<p>Started from the bottom now we're here. No joke though. They are in the top 500 top growing companies in the USA and they deserve it! Started from YouTube to become an affordable, and incredible MakeUp brand. Their eyeshadow formula is hands down one of the best in the market. They have expanded their line so much over the years. While they are still working on foundations and concealers, they have already launnched bronzers and blushes. They are just as buttery and smooth as the eyeshadow formula. A great thing about MakeUp Geek is that they also categorize shades by Porcelain, Fair, Medium, and Dark skin so it makes it easier for shoppers to choose their right shade.</p>

					<p>Such. Awesome. Brushes. Morphe was definitely on the radar this past year. Who needs MAC brushes when you can get the same qualities brushes for half the price? Their palettes are also incredible for their price! If someone is trying to get involved more with MakeUp they should start here for sure. The only down side is that they only have one location in Burbank so if you do not live in the SoCal area, you're going to have to order it online. But that isn't too bad considering their eyeshadows go for just $2! Not to mention all the other contour, blush, and concealer palettes they offer at, again, an incredible price.</p>

					<h2 class="title">Urban Decay: Featuring Ruby Rose</h2>
					<p>Now, can we stop for just a minute and admire her beauty? Okay now that that is done let's go on to the brand Urban Decay itself. They have been on the market for a long time and they have always known how to kick ass. They have always had one of the best packaging in Sephora, and they have amazing quality products. The Naked line was a huge success, even though now I think they have dragged it out for a little too long. Time to do something new! And that is exactly what they did when they creating 100 new lipsticks in 6 different finishes. Now that is impressive indeed. Plus getting Ruby Rose as the face of the new Vice lipsticks? An even smarter move. Urban Decay definitely knows how to market their brand better than most. Of course Urban Decay will forever stay an edgy brand with an amazing color selection; however, it would be nice to see if they would include more neutral and transition shades in their palettes so they could be more universal and used on their own without needed to have other shadows to blend everything out.</p>
